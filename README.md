- Option to 're-link' a live window and saved window. Will help fix decoupling when a saved window is open and chrome is quick. Can this be done automatically?
- Save windows in custom categories
- Double-click a tab to bring it to the foreground (or load it if unloaded)
- Try to weed out blank or 'loading' titles
- Edit saved windows/tabs (crud)
- Improve UI
